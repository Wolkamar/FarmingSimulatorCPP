Simple farming clicker

Run .exe in bin\Debug folder, or you may need to update paths to some files used by game.

Set game speed and go sell some carrots!

Rules:

Plant cost 2$

Initial sell cost 5$, after 3rd upgrade 7$, after last upgrade sell cost will be 10$.
First two upgrades just makes available field bigger.

If carrot is overgrown its dead, removing it from field costs 1$

You can also harvest carrot in 'almost ready' state, for young carrot you'll get (current cost - 2$)

Goal of the game is to get 2000$

If your balance reaches 0$ - you're dead.

Optimal game speed is around 6-7, otherwise you'll probably waste too much money or game will become boring.

Save feature really works.

Good luck!
